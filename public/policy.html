      information with us.

      obligations. We indicate the specific processing grounds we rely on next to each purpose listed below.

      We use the information we collect or receive:

      To facilitate account creation and logon process. If you choose to link your account with us to a third party
      account (such as your Google or Facebook account), we use the information you allowed us to collect from those
      third parties to facilitate account creation and logon process for the performance of the contract.

      To send you marketing and promotional communications. We and/or our third party marketing partners may use the
      personal information you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with your marketing
      preferences. You can opt-out of our marketing emails at any time (see the "WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS" below).

      To send administrative information to you. We may use your personal information to send you product, service and
      new feature information and/or information about changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.

      protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.

      We may process or share data based on the following legal basis:
      Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information in a
      specific purpose.

      Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business
      interests.

      Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal

      Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply
      with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in
      response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or
      law enforcement requirements).

      Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or
      take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
      threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are
      involved.
      More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following
      situations:

      Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your data with third party vendors,
      service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such
      information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting
      services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology
      on the Services, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the Services over time. This
      information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain
      content and better understand online activity. Unless described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or
      trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.

      Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any
      merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

      Third-Party Advertisers. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Services.
      These companies may use information about your visits to our Website(s) and other websites that are contained in
      web cookies and other tracking technologies in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of
      interest to you.


      4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
      In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.

      We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store

      set out in our Cookie Policy.



      5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

      In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
      policy unless otherwise required by law.

      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
      privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
      other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer
      than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
      backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
      processing until deletion is possible.


      6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

      In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security
      measures.

      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security
      of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet
      itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
      personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a
      secure environment.



      7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

      In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.

      information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can
      find their contact details here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.

      If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at agrawal.rohun@gmail.com.

      Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our
      active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems,
      assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.

      Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can
      usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or
      reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. To opt-out of interest-based

      unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will then

      8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
      feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
      activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
      automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
      policy.



      9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

      In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your
      personal information.

      California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are
      California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories
      of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and
      addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar
      year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in
      writing to us using the contact information provided below.

      If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Services, you have
      the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such
      data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated
      with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly
      displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed
      from our systems.



      10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?

      In Short: Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.

      We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
      “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes
      to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly

      DISPUTE RESOLUTION

      Informal Negotiations

      To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use
      (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and
      collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes
      expressly provided below) informally for at least __________ days before initiating arbitration. Such informal
      negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

      Binding Arbitration

      Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract, including any question regarding its existence,
      validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the International Commercial Arbitration
      Court under the European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to the Rules of
      this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is considered as the part of this clause. The number of
      arbitrators shall be __________. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be __________. The language of
      the proceedings shall be __________. The governing law of the contract shall be the substantive law of
      __________.

      Restrictions

      The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the
      full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right
      or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and
      (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf
      of the general public or any other persons.

      Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

      The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal
      negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity
      of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations
      of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this
      provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling
      within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
      court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit
      to the personal jurisdiction of that court.


      CORRECTIONS

      There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including
      descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information. We reserve the right to correct any errors,
      inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update the information on the Site at any time, without prior notice.
